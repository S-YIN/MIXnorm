Description: MIXnorm is a RNA-seq data normalization method developed for Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues RNA-seq data. MIXnorm is based on a two-component mixture model. Expressed genes are modeled by truncated normal distributions (in natural log scale). Non-expressed genes are modeled by zero-inflated Poisson distributions. Note that though designed for FFPE RNA-seq data, MIXnorm is directly applicable to fresh frozen or like sample RNA-seq data.
